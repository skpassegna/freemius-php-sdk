# Freemius PHP SDK Documentation

## I. Introduction

### 1. What is Freemius?

Freemius is a platform that simplifies the process of selling and managing premium WordPress plugins and themes. It provides a suite of tools for licensing, distribution, analytics, marketing, and more, allowing developers to focus on building great products while Freemius handles the business side.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Licensing:** Freemius provides a secure licensing system to protect your premium products from unauthorized use.
- **Subscriptions:** Freemius enables you to offer subscription-based pricing models for your products, recurring billing, and automated renewals.
- **User Accounts:** Freemius creates user accounts for your customers, allowing them to manage their licenses, subscriptions, and access support.
- **Analytics:** Freemius provides detailed analytics on plugin usage, sales, and customer behavior, giving you insights to improve your products and marketing.

### 2. What is the Freemius PHP SDK?

The Freemius PHP SDK is a tool that allows you to interact with the Freemius API from your PHP applications. It provides a convenient way to access and manage data related to your Freemius products, users, licenses, and more. 

This SDK is designed to be:

- **PHP 8.2+ Compatible:**  Leverage the latest PHP features and performance improvements.
- **Easy to Install:** Install seamlessly using Composer.
- **Developer-Friendly:**  Use a modern HTTP client (Guzzle) and includes clear error handling.
- **Secure:** Communicate securely with the Freemius API.
- **Well-Documented:**  Learn how to use the SDK effectively with comprehensive documentation.

### 3. Why an Unofficial SDK?

This is an unofficial Freemius PHP SDK created to address limitations in the official SDK. The key motivations for this project are:

- **Composer Autoloading Issues:** The official SDK was difficult to integrate with Composer's autoloading mechanism. This SDK strictly follows PSR-4 autoloading standards for easy integration.
- **Lack of Clear Documentation:** The official SDK lacked clear, task-oriented documentation, making it challenging to use. This SDK will have comprehensive, beginner-friendly documentation with practical examples.
- **Lack of Maintenance:**  The official SDK appeared to be unmaintained. This SDK will be actively maintained to ensure compatibility and add new features.
